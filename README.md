#Case Study of Customer Retention Prediction Model
Developing customer retention prediction models involves utilizing historical interaction data to forecast whether a customer is likely to stay with a service or discontinue their subscription. The data used for these predictive models typically includes user behavior, product usage statistics, and customer feedback. These models help identify patterns that signal customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction, which can be leveraged to improve retention strategies.

Consider a subscription-based video streaming service with a rich dataset capturing customer viewing habits, subscription plans, and customer service interactions. The company aims to predict customer retention to tailor personalized offers and content suggestions that enhance engagement and reduce churn. By analyzing past behavior, the model provides insights into which customers are at risk of canceling, allowing the company to proactively engage them with targeted retention efforts.
